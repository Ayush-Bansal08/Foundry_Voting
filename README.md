This is a simple and secure on-chain Voting smart contract built using Solidity. It allows participants to:
1. Register themselves as candidates by paying ETH.
2. Allow voters to cast votes for registered candidates.
3. Let the contract owner pick the winning candidate based on votes.
4. Transfer all collected ETH to the winner.

âœ¨ Features
âœ… Transparent ETH-based registration for candidates
âœ… One-vote-per-address enforcement
âœ… Fully on-chain voting and result computation
âœ… Prize pool distributed to winner securely
âœ… Protected owner-only access to result declaration

âœ¨Security Considerations
âœ… onlyOwner modifier ensures only the deployer can pick a winner.
âœ… Voter addresses are tracked to prevent duplicate votes.
âœ… Reverts are used to enforce proper flow (e.g., voting only for existing candidates).

ðŸš€Real-World Applicability
âœ… Can be used in DAOs, online communities, college elections, or board voting systems.
âœ… Transparent logs and on-chain proof make it perfect for verifiable public voting.


## Foundry

**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**

Foundry consists of:

-   **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
-   **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
-   **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
-   **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.
